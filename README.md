# SpendSentry 
This is the project which is build in **ETHIndia 2023** hackathon. This is a web3 based dApp to Pay, Track, Notify.
This project is built in **ETHIndia 2023** hackathon which aims to develop a dApp to Pay, Track and Notify all funds on our platform making it convinient and easily accessible to both organizations and end users. 

###  Features 

- Registration of the organisation :
    Here registration of organization is done through Minting an **NFT**.

- Organization adding categories through which they need to receive funds :
  For example, Think college as an organization. So college will create categories like, Student fees, Mess fees, Infrastructural developmental fees, Governement funding, Donations. So when a user wants to pay the fund to the organization, they need to select under which category they will pay to the organisation, So that the application will have the track of how much ETH was paid to an organizations under different categories.

- We are not directly sending the ETH paid by the user to the organization... Interesting!! :
  When the user pay to a organization, we are not directly paying to the account of the organization. Instead all the amount paid by the user will be added to the account of the smart contract and by using the contract states we are tracking how much was paid to a organization

- Send the ETH to the destination account from organization :
  When Organization wants to use the funds with them in this application then they need to give the destination address to which the organization needs to pay and the ETH will be transfered from the smart contract to the destination account.
